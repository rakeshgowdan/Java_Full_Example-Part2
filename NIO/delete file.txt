Files.delete()
The Files.delete() method can delete a file or directory. Here is a Java Files.delete() example:

Path path = Paths.get("data/subdir/logging-moved.properties");

try {
    Files.delete(path);
} catch (IOException e) {
    //deleting file failed
    e.printStackTrace();
}
First the Path pointing to the file to delete is created.
 Second the Files.delete() method is called. If the Files.delete() fails to delete the file for some reason (e.g. the file or directory does not exist),
 an IOException is thrown.
