/*Java BufferedInputStream class is used to read information from stream. It internally uses buffer mechanism to make the performance fast.

The important points about BufferedInputStream are:

When the bytes from the stream are skipped or read, the internal buffer automatically refilled from the contained input stream, many bytes at a time.
When a BufferedInputStream is created, an internal buffer array is created.*/
